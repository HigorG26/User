# Doubly Linked Lists chained to a Hashtable

Project developed to better understand how Hashtables and Interfaces work in Java, as well as evaluation purposes in my university.
It's main idea is to create a hash key based on the sum of ASCII codes in a string. The nodes are added in order of priority (0 is high and 1 is low).

Known Issues:
- Inputting the same name twice without removing it first may break the list chained to that position.
